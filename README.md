🚦 Smart City Traffic Volume Forecasting

A Machine Learning + Streamlit project for predicting short-term traffic volume using real metro interstate traffic data. Built as part of the Smart City AI Lab Assignment.

📌 Project Overview

This project uses historical traffic and weather data from the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset to:

Preprocess spatiotemporal data

Build a Random Forest regression model

Predict traffic volume for upcoming time periods

Visualize predictions using a Streamlit dashboard

The goal is to simulate a basic smart-city module for traffic monitoring and forecasting.
